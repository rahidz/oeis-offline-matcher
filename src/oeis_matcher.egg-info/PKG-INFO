# OEIS Offline Matcher

Python-based offline helper inspired by OEIS Superseeker. It downloads a local snapshot of OEIS data, builds lightweight indexes, and matches user-provided integer sequences against:
- Direct OEIS entries (exact, prefix, subsequence).
- (Planned) transformations of a single sequence (e.g., scale, shift, diff, partial sums).
- (Planned) small linear combinations of a few sequences with simple transforms.

## Status
Early scaffolding. See `TODO.md` for the detailed roadmap.

## Quick Start
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Download raw OEIS exports (once, cached in data/raw)
scripts/fetch_oeis_data.sh

# Build SQLite index in data/processed/oeis.db
oeis build-index

# Match a sequence (prefix by default)
oeis match "0,1,1,2,3,5,8"

# Allow subsequence search
oeis match "2,3,5" --subsequence --limit 5
```

## Design Notes
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Data lives in `data/raw` (downloaded `stripped.gz`, `names.gz`) and `data/processed` (parsed/indexed artifacts).
- Configuration (to come): `config.toml` for transform limits and coefficient ranges; environment variables can override paths and limits.
- Storage: simple SQLite with basic invariants (prefix5 hash, min/max, gcd). Easy to evolve later.
